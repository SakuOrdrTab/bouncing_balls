# bouncing_balls
Python exercise to bounce balls all over the screen

When I started programming, my first project was to build a simple canvas of bouncing balls in a screen with delphi. It was easy and fun and when I was learning python, I thought it was a good idea to make a similar app with python. Little did I know, what rabbit hole i was diving in. I don't know about about Java anymore, but at the time delphi was the GUI to go for. It was simple and let's say, the project was easy. But with python, already the choosing of a suitable GUI framework was difficult for a beginner. I considered tkinter and kivy, but decided to go with PyQT/Pyside. I think that was a good choice and even today, if I was to start on a ambitious application with GUI, I would definately recommend PyQT. But it is not simple.  

I am sure that I would design the whole architecture differently. But here it is, in it's flaws but without errors. I would not recommend doing the things my way, but I hope this helps other devs in their endevours.

Project plan:

1. Game logic: balls, balls bouncing, graphics without GUI >> ver 1.0
  - Pyside6

2. Gui >> ver 2.0
  - Pyside6

3. Functionality, add balls, destroy balls, gamification (achievements, score, etc)  ver 3.0
  - ??

5. Statistics incorporation? ver 4.0
  - (some)SQL, seaborn?

Current stable version:
0.1
